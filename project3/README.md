# Project 3

## Machine learning applied to PDEs and Eigenvalues

### Overview of file structure 

 - `figs` contain the figures included in our report
 - `report` containts the `.tex`, `.bib`, and `.pdf` of our report
 - `src` contains all code and a `README.md` describing its use
 - `main.py` runs the simulations and generates the plots used in the report

To test the code one can simply run `main.py`.

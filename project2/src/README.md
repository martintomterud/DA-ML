# Overview of the code files herein and their use

## Imported from project 1

The following files are imported from project 1 in order to reuse some of the functionality again

 - `dataFunctions.py`
 - `regressionClass.py`
 - `franke.py`

## Written source for project 2

The following files are written for project 2

- `sgd.py` contains all the code for the differetn gradient descent solvers
- `logisticRegression.py` contains the code for logistic regression
- `prepareData.py` contains code that loads data and preprocess it before it is used in the various methods
- `neuralNet.py` is the implementation of the feedforward neural network

## Main files

Code in the followig files are called by `main.py` and produces the results in our report

 - `plot_sgd.py` for the gradient descent results
 - `plot_logreg.py` for the logistic regression results
 - `plot_nn.py` and `plot_nn_classifier.py` for the neural network results

This git folder contains multiple folders that together pose an answer the second project in the course FYS-STK4155 
given at UiO Autumn 2022.
The structure is as follows;

- src: Contains all source code and main code functionality that executes the source code and generate our results
- figs: Figures included in the report
- data: contains a copy of the breast cancer data. This ended up not being used as we loaded it directly from sklearn
- report: contains .tex and .pdf file of our report.
